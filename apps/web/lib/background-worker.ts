 * single long-running Node server (dev, and a single-instance deploy like
 * Railway) that something is this in-process loop: it claims queued runs and
 * runs the long workflows in the background, with all state in Postgres so it
 * stays resumable. A multi-instance deploy would instead run a dedicated worker
 * process that pokes /api/workflows/run-next; this loop is the single-instance
 * form of the same thing. Wired up from instrumentation.ts on server start.
